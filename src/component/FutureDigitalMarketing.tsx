        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Artificial Intelligence and Automation
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          AI-powered tools are revolutionizing digital marketing by enabling personalized experiences, predictive analytics, and automation. Chatbots, AI-generated content, and smart recommendations will enhance customer interactions, reducing human intervention while improving efficiency.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Voice Search and Conversational Marketing
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          With the rise of voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, optimizing content for voice search is becoming crucial. Conversational marketing, driven by AI chatbots and voice-activated devices, will make interactions more natural and user-friendly.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Video and Interactive Content
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Video content continues to dominate digital marketing, with short-form videos, live streaming, and interactive elements engaging audiences more effectively. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) will create immersive brand experiences, offering new ways to connect with consumers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Hyper-Personalization and Data-Driven Marketing
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Consumers expect highly tailored experiences based on their behavior, preferences, and browsing history. Data-driven marketing, powered by AI and machine learning, will help brands deliver more precise messaging, improving engagement and conversions.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Blockchain and Privacy-First Marketing
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          With increasing concerns over data privacy, blockchain technology will enhance transparency in digital advertising, reducing fraud and ensuring authentic user data protection. Marketers will need to balance personalization with compliance, following strict data regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          The Evolution of SEO and Search Algorithms
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Search engines are becoming more sophisticated, prioritizing user intent, experience, and E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness). Future SEO strategies will focus on semantic search, zero-click searches, and AI-driven ranking factors.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Sustainability and Ethical Marketing
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
